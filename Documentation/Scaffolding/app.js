 * ExpressJS - Scaffolding
 * ------------------------
 * Scaffolding allows us to easily create a skeleton for a web application. We manually create our 
 * public directory, add middleware, create separate route files, etc. A scaffolding tool sets up all 
 * these things for us so that we can directly get started with building our application.
 * 
 * The scaffolder we will use is called Yeoman. It is a scaffolding tool built for Node.js but also has 
 * generators for several other frameworks (like flask, rails, django, etc.). To install Yeoman, enter 
 * the following command in your terminal −
 * 
 *      npm install -g yeoman
 * 
 * Yeoman uses generators to scaffold out applications. In this tutorial, we will use the 
 * 'generator-Express-simple'. To install this generator, enter the following command in your terminal −
 *  
 *      npm install -g generator-express-simple
 * 
 * To use this generator, enter the following command −
 * 
 *      yo express-simple test-app
 * 
 * You will be asked a few simple questions like what things you want to use with your app. Select the 
 * following answers, or if you already know about these technologies then go about choosing how you 
 * want them to be.
 * 
 * It will then create a new application for you, install all the dependencies, add few pages to your 
 * application(home page, 404 not found page, etc.) and give you a directory structure to work on.
 * 
 * This generator creates a very simple structure for us. Explore the many generators available 
 * for Express and choose the one that fits you right. Steps to working with all generators is the 
 * same. You will need to install a generator, run it using Yeoman; it will ask you some questions 
 * and then create a skeleton for your application based on your answers.
