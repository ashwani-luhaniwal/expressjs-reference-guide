 * Express
 * --------
 * ExpressJS is a web application framework that provides you with a simple API to build websites, 
 * web apps and back ends. With ExpressJS, you need not worry about low level protocols, processes, etc
 * 
 * Express provides a minimal interface to build our applications. It provides us the tools that are 
 * required to build our app. It is flexible as there are numerous modules available on npm, which can 
 * be directly plugged into Express.
 * 
 * Express was developed by TJ Holowaychuk and is maintained by the Node.js foundation and numerous open 
 * source contributors.
 * 
 * --------------
 * Why Express ?
 * --------------
 * Unlike its competitors like Rails and Django, which have an opinionated way of building applications, 
 * Express has no "best way" to do something. It is very flexible and pluggable.
