/**

 * ExpressJS - Middleware
 * -----------------------
 * Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response 
 * object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. These 
 * functions are used to modify req and res objects for tasks like parsing request bodies, adding 
 * response headers, etc.

    // request and is in the next middleware function route handler

// The above middleware is called for every request on the server. So after every request, we will get 
// the message in the console
